# 1. TOOLS TO INSTALL 💻
As an aspiring bioinformatician, it's very important to familiarise yourself with some of the tools you're likely to use.

To begin, install the following tools in **SEPARATE** environments:
1. sra-toolkit
2. BBMap
3. FastQC
4. Flye
5. Porechop
6. Qiime2
7. SPAdes
8. Trimmomatic

**🔎 NOTE: Don't just install, google each tool to understand what they are used for!**

# 2. Play around with Linux 👨🏾‍💻👩🏾‍💻!
In our 1st session, we covered some **basic Linux commands** for navigating through directories and manipulating files, e.g. `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `nano` etc.

Practice using these commands by performing the following tasks:
1. Create a directory and name it *bfxclub*
2. Create a file inside your new directory
3. Inside the file, list about 5 organisms (their species names) that you're interested in working with

🙋🏾‍♂🙋🏾‍♀️ If you have any problems performing these tasks, reach out to any of our trainers! (Check them out [here](https://github.com/sianicole/bfx_club_ke/blob/main/README.md))

# 3. Download sequences🧬
Using your sra-toolkit, download the following sequences from SRA onto your computers:
1. Create a directory called Bacterial-Genomics
2. Download E. coli K12 MG1655 - Bisulfite-seq (SRR13921543) and Salmonella Typhi samples (ERR2093245)
3. We will use these sequences for training

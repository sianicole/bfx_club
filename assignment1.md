# 1. TOOLS TO INSTALL 💻
As an aspiring bioinformatician, it's very important to familiarise yourself with some of the tools you're likely to use.

To begin, install the following tools in **SEPARATE** environments:
1. BBMap
2. FastQC
3. Flye
4. Porechop
5. Qiime 
6. SPAdes
7. SRAToolkit
8. Trimmomatic

**🔎 NOTE: Don't just install, google each tool to understand what they are used for!**

# 2. Play around with Linux 👨🏾‍💻👩🏾‍💻!
In our 1st session, we covered some **basic Linux commands** for navigating through directories and manipulating files, e.g. `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `nano` etc.

Practice using these commands by performing the following tasks:
1. Create a directory and name it *bfxclub*
2. Create a file inside your new directory
3. Inside the file, list about 5 organisms (their species names) that you're interested in working with

🙋🏾‍♂🙋🏾‍♀️ If you have any problems performing these tasks, reach out to any of our trainers! (Check them out [here](https://github.com/sianicole/bfx_club_ke/blob/main/README.md))
